   - Modern format implementation with the `<picture>` element and `<source>` tags
   - Favicon images are available in both PNG and WebP formats

2. **Responsive Image Sizes**:
   - Each image is available in three sizes: 400w, 800w, and 1200w
   - Appropriate image size is served based on viewport width and device pixel ratio
   - Consistent aspect ratio is maintained across different sizes (4:3 for gallery images)
   - Hero section uses CSS media queries to load appropriate background images

3. **Responsive Implementation**:
   - Uses the `<picture>` element with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
   - The `sizes` attribute is properly configured: `sizes="(max-width: 576px) 400px, (max-width: 992px) 350px, 382px"`
   - Explicit width and height attributes to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   - CSS properties like `aspect-ratio: 4/3` and `object-fit: cover` for consistent rendering

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading implemented with `loading="lazy"` attribute on all gallery images
   - Asynchronous decoding with `decoding="async"` attribute
   - Critical hero image is preloaded: `<link rel="preload" href="../img/gallery/out_front_right_800w.webp" as="image" fetchpriority="high">`

The implementation follows SEO best practices for international websites and ensures proper language signaling to both users and search engines. Key elements of the current implementation include:

1. **Directory-Based URL Structure**:
   - Each language has its own dedicated directory: `/et/` (Estonian), `/en/` (English), and `/ru/` (Russian)
   - Clean URLs are used for language versions (e.g., `/en/` instead of `/en/index.html`)
   - Estonian is set as the default language
   - All pages maintain the same structure across language versions (index.html, rental-terms.html, privacy-policy.html, cookie-policy.html)

2. **HTML Language Attributes**:
   - Each language version correctly sets the `lang` attribute in the HTML tag (e.g., `<html lang="en">` for English)
   - Content-language meta tags are included: `<meta http-equiv="content-language" content="en">`
   - These attributes help browsers, screen readers, and search engines identify the language of the content

3. **Hreflang Implementation**:
   - Comprehensive hreflang annotations are implemented for all language versions
   - The `generateHreflangLinks()` function in build.js creates links for all supported languages
   - x-default hreflang points to the Estonian version (the default language)
   - Format: `<link rel="alternate" href="https://tartuhaagissuvila.ee/[lang]/[page]" hreflang="[lang]">`
   - Hreflang annotations are also included in the sitemap.xml

4. **Translation System**:
   - Comprehensive JSON translation files for all three languages in build/translations/
   - Translation keys are consistent across all language files
   - All content is properly translated with excellent content parity
   - The build.js script processes these files and replaces placeholders in templates
   - Translation keys are used in HTML with data-translate-key attributes (e.g., `data-translate-key="hero_title"`)

5. **Language Switcher**:
   - Implemented in the navbar with flag icons for visual identification
   - Present in both desktop and mobile views
   - Uses absolute URLs to language directories
   - Example: `<a class="nav-link lang-link" href="/en/" data-lang="en" title="English">`
   - Flag images include appropriate alt text for accessibility

6. **Language Detection and Redirection**:
   - Root index.html implements intelligent language detection
   - Uses localStorage to remember user's language preference
   - Falls back to browser language detection if no preference is stored
   - Defaults to Estonian if no preference or browser language is detected
   - Provides manual language selection links as a fallback
   - Meta refresh tag as additional fallback: `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/et/">`

7. **Canonical URLs**:
   - Each language version has its own canonical URL
   - Generated through the `generateCanonicalLink()` function in build.js
   - Format: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://tartuhaagissuvila.ee/[lang]/[page]">`
   - Helps prevent duplicate content issues across language versions

8. **Open Graph Localization**:
   - Open Graph tags include language-specific content
   - Locale tags are set appropriately (e.g., og:locale="en_US" for English)
   - Alternate locales are specified for other languages
   - Generated through the `generateMetaTags()` function in build.js

9. **Search Engine Discoverability**:
   - Sitemap.xml includes all pages in all languages with proper hreflang annotations
   - Each URL entry in the sitemap includes alternate language versions
   - Robots.txt explicitly allows crawling of all language directories
   - All language versions are set to "index, follow" in meta robots tags

10. **Structured Data Localization**:
    - JSON-LD structured data is localized for each language
    - The inLanguage property is correctly set for each language version
    - Content within structured data is translated appropriately
    - Generated through the `readStructuredDataFile()` function in build.js

### Issues Identified

1. **Missing Hreflang Tags in HTML Head**: ✅ FIXED
   - ~~While hreflang links are generated in the build.js script, they are not visible in the HTML head section of the examined pages~~
   - ~~This could be an implementation issue where the generated hreflang links are not being properly inserted into the final HTML~~
   - Hreflang links are now properly implemented with clean URLs (without "index.html") for the homepage
   - Duplicate hreflang links have been removed to prevent confusion for search engines

2. **Incomplete Language Metadata in HTML**:
   - Some HTML pages are missing the content-language meta tag
   - This tag provides additional language signals to browsers and search engines

3. **No Language Parameter in Sitemap URLs**:
   - The lastmod, changefreq, and priority parameters are set in the sitemap.xml, but there's no language parameter
   - While not critical, this could provide additional language information to search engines

4. **No Language Annotations in JSON-LD**:
   - Some structured data elements could benefit from additional language annotations
   - This would enhance the machine-readability of the multilingual content

5. **No Language-Specific XML Sitemaps**:
   - The website uses a single sitemap.xml file for all languages
   - Separate sitemaps for each language could provide more granular control

6. **No Geo-Targeting in Search Console**:
   - There's no indication of country-specific targeting in the implementation
   - This could be beneficial for the Estonian version to target local users

7. **Limited Language Detection Algorithm**:
   - The current language detection only checks for exact language matches
   - It doesn't handle language variants (e.g., en-US, en-GB) optimally

8. **No Indication of Translated vs. Original Content**:
   - There's no clear indication of which content is original and which is translated
   - This transparency can be valuable for users and search engines

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Hreflang Implementation**: ✅ FIXED
   - ~~Ensure hreflang links are properly inserted into the HTML head section of all pages~~
   - ~~Verify the implementation in the build process to ensure the generated links are included~~
   - Hreflang links are now properly implemented with clean URLs and without duplication
   - Example format:
     ```html
     <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://tartuhaagissuvila.ee/en/" />
     <link rel="alternate" hreflang="et" href="https://tartuhaagissuvila.ee/et/" />
     <link rel="alternate" hreflang="ru" href="https://tartuhaagissuvila.ee/ru/" />
     <link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://tartuhaagissuvila.ee/et/" />
     ```

2. **Add Content-Language Meta Tags**:
   - Ensure all pages include the content-language meta tag
   - Example: `<meta http-equiv="content-language" content="en">`
   - This provides an additional language signal to browsers and search engines

3. **Enhance Language Detection**:
   - Improve the language detection algorithm to handle language variants
   - Example: Recognize 'en-US', 'en-GB', etc. as English variants
   - Consider using a more sophisticated language detection library

4. **Implement Language-Specific XML Sitemaps**:
   - Create separate sitemaps for each language (sitemap-en.xml, sitemap-et.xml, sitemap-ru.xml)
   - Include these in a sitemap index file
   - This provides more granular control and clearer organization

5. **Add Language Annotations to Structured Data**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Impact: Medium - Enhances machine-readability of multilingual content
   - Difficulty: Low - Simple JSON-LD additions
   - Action: ~~Include the inLanguage property in all JSON-LD structured data~~
   - Result: All structured data components now include proper language annotations with inLanguage property for each language version

6. **Implement Geo-Targeting for Estonian Content**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Impact: Medium - Improves local search relevance for Estonian market
   - Difficulty: Low - Configuration change
   - Action: ~~Use hreflang="et-EE" for Estonian version and set up geo-targeting in Search Console~~
   - Result: Estonian content now uses et-EE hreflang for geo-targeting Estonia specifically, implemented in build.js generateHreflangLinks() function

7. **Add Original vs. Translated Content Indicators**:
   - Consider adding a meta tag to indicate original vs. translated content
   - Example: `<meta name="translation-source" content="original">` or `<meta name="translation-source" content="translated-from-et">`
   - This transparency can be valuable for users and search engines

8. **Implement URL Language Parameters as Alternative**:
   - Consider supporting language parameters in URLs as an alternative to directory-based structure
   - Example: `?lang=en` as an alternative to `/en/`
   - This provides more flexibility for sharing URLs across languages

9. **Add Language Toggle Persistence**:
   - Ensure that when users switch languages, they stay on the same page rather than being redirected to the homepage
   - This improves user experience when switching languages mid-browsing

10. **Implement Browser Language Detection Feedback**:
    - Add a small notification when automatically redirecting based on browser language
    - Example: "We've directed you to the English version based on your browser settings. [Switch to Estonian]"
    - This improves transparency and user control over language selection

## Performance Optimization

## Conclusion

The caravan rental website has been significantly improved with the implementation of Core Web Vitals optimizations. The website now demonstrates excellent performance, accessibility, and mobile-friendliness, which are critical factors for both user experience and search engine rankings.

The key improvements implemented include:

1. **Image Optimization**: AVIF format support has been added for all images with proper fallbacks to WebP and JPEG, providing better compression and faster loading times. The hero image loading has been optimized with preloading and format-specific optimizations.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Render-blocking resources have been eliminated or deferred, particularly the Google Tag Manager script which now loads after the page with a 2-second delay. CSS and JavaScript resources are properly optimized to prevent render blocking.

3. **Mobile Usability**: Touch target sizes have been enhanced to meet the 48px minimum recommendation, with proper spacing between interactive elements. Mobile navigation has been improved with larger touch targets and better accessibility.

4. **Meta Tags Enhancement**: Mobile-specific meta tags have been added, including Apple-specific tags for better iOS integration. Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags now include proper image dimensions and alt text for better social sharing.

5. **JavaScript Optimization**: Passive event listeners have been implemented for all scroll, touch, and wheel events, reducing main thread work and improving interactivity metrics.

These improvements directly address the Core Web Vitals metrics:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Optimized with preloaded hero images, AVIF format support, and reduced render-blocking resources.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Improved with explicit size attributes for all images and dynamic content, proper font loading strategies, and layout containment.
- **First Input Delay (FID)/Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Enhanced with deferred JavaScript execution, passive event listeners, and optimized event handling.

The website now provides a significantly better user experience across all devices and browsers, with particular attention to mobile users. These optimizations not only improve search engine rankings but also enhance user engagement and potentially increase conversion rates.

Regular monitoring of Core Web Vitals metrics through tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and real user monitoring is recommended to ensure continued performance excellence as the website evolves.
