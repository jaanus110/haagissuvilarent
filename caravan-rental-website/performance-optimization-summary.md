# Performance Optimization Summary

This document summarizes all the performance optimizations that have been implemented on the caravan rental website (tartuhaagissuvila.ee) to improve its PageSpeed Insights score.

## Completed Optimizations

### Accessibility Improvements
- Added title attribute to Google Maps iframe in all language versions (ET, EN, RU)
- Fixed heading hierarchy by changing h5 elements to h3 elements with h5 styling in all language versions

### Image Optimizations
- Optimized image loading with proper sizing and responsive images
- Removed unnecessary 1200w images from srcset to reduce bandwidth
- Added width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts
- Added fetchpriority="high" to LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) image
- Added lazy loading for non-critical images

### Resource Loading Optimizations
- Added preconnect hints for important third-party domains (cdn.jsdelivr.net, googletagmanager.com)
- Added preload for critical CSS
- Added dns-prefetch for third-party domains
- Optimized JavaScript loading with defer attributes
- Reduced unused CSS by optimizing Bootstrap usage

## Implementation Guides Created

### WebP Implementation Guide
- Created a comprehensive guide for converting JPG/PNG images to WebP format
- Provided instructions for implementing WebP with proper fallbacks using the `<picture>` element
- Included examples for responsive images with WebP
- Added JavaScript code for WebP feature detection for CSS background images

### Cache Headers Implementation Guide
- Created a guide for implementing proper cache headers for static assets
- Provided instructions for different server types (Apache, Nginx, IIS)
- Included examples for different file types (images, CSS, JavaScript, fonts)
- Added explanation of cache control directives and their impact on performance

## Pending Implementations (To Be Done by Website Owner)

### WebP Image Conversion
- Convert all JPG/PNG images to WebP format using the provided script
- Implement WebP images with proper fallbacks using the `<picture>` element as described in the guide

### Cache Headers Implementation
- Implement proper cache headers for static assets based on the provided guide
- Configure server to set appropriate cache headers for different file types

## Expected Performance Improvements

Once all optimizations are implemented, the website should see significant improvements in the following PageSpeed Insights metrics:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Improved by optimizing image loading and adding fetchpriority
- First Input Delay (FID): Improved by optimizing JavaScript loading with defer attributes
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Improved by adding width and height attributes to images
- Total Blocking Time (TBT): Improved by reducing render-blocking resources
- Speed Index: Improved by optimizing image loading and implementing proper cache headers

## Additional Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. Implement a service worker for offline caching and faster repeat visits
2. Further reduce third-party JavaScript or load it asynchronously
3. Set up a CDN for static assets to reduce latency
4. Implement font optimization techniques (font-display: swap, preload critical fonts)
5. Consider implementing responsive images with art direction using the `<picture>` element
6. Implement critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
7. Consider using next-gen image formats like AVIF for even better compression
