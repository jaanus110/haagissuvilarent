By using our website, you agree to the use of cookies in accordance with this policy.\n\nWhat are cookies? Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the site owners.\n\nTypes of cookies we use: We only use essential cookies on our website. These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly and cannot be turned off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions made by you that amount to a request for services, such as setting language preferences.\n\n2. Essential Cookies Used\n\nBelow is a list of the essential cookies used on our website:\n\n    Name: preferredLanguage\n    Purpose: To remember your selected language preference so you don't have to set it again on future visits. This allows us to automatically display the website content in your chosen language.\n    Storage Method: localStorage (a type of web storage that allows websites to store data locally within the user's browser).\n    Duration: This data remains in your browser's localStorage until you manually delete it (e.g., by clearing browser cache and site data). There is no expiration date set by us.\n\nWe do not use any non-essential cookies, such as for analytics, advertising, or tracking.\n\n3. How to Manage Cookies\n\nSince we only use an essential cookie stored via localStorage for language preference, traditional cookie consent banners are not required. However, you can still review and/or delete localStorage data if you wish.\n\nBrowser Settings: Most web browsers allow some control over cookies (including localStorage) through browser settings. These are typically found under the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.\n\nDeleting LocalStorage Data: You can delete data stored in localStorage by websites by clearing your browser's cache, browsing history, or site data.

This does not affect the core functionality of the website, except for language display.\n\n4. Changes to This Cookie Policy\n\nWe may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Cookie Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Cookie Policy periodically for any updates.
